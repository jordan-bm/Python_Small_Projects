# Python Small Projects

This repository is a curated collection of small Python scripts completing fundamental computer science problems and algorithms. Each file is a self-contained project, demonstrating concepts such as recursion, search, prime checking, and string manipulation

## Contents

Each project is listed below and can be run independently:

- `binarySearch.py` — Searches for an element in a sorted list using binary search recursion
- `coinToss.py` — Simulates repeated coin tosses and tracks probability
- `factorial.py` — Calculates factorials using both loops and recursion
- `fibonacci.py` — Generates Fibonacci numbers using recursion
- `indexANDvalue.py` — Demonstrates indexing and value retrieval in lists
- `isPrime_function.py` — Determines if numbers are prime using efficient algorithms
- `mode_v1.py` (Subfolder `mode_v1`) — Determines the statistical mode of values in a dataset — .txt files are provided within the subfolder for program testing. When prompted by script the enter a filename, enter input(1-4).txt
- `netID.py` — Simple string manipulation for ID and password generation
- `palindrome.py` — Checks if a given string is a palindrome
- `recursion_findnum.py` — Finds numbers in a list recursively
- `timeFromSeconds.py` — Converts seconds to readable time formats
- `ulamList.py` — Produces Ulam sequences for a given number

## How to Use

- Run any script with:

python filename.py

- Each script is stand-alone and only requires standard Python libraries.

## Requirements

All scripts use only Python’s built-in libraries and functions. No external dependencies are needed. All code runs with:
- Python 3.6 or higher
